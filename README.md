# REAPER-Scripts
Various REAPER scripts that I use in creating sample libraries

- dsh_Decrease item rate by 1 cent: Decreases item's rate by 1 cent. I map this to Shift+3.
- dsh_Increase item rate by 1 cent: Boosts an item's rate by 1 cent. I map this to Shift+4.
- dsh_Update_Region_Based_on_Item_Bounds: If you've got an item and a region that is almost the same size as the item, run this script and it will resize the region to match the items bounds exactly.
